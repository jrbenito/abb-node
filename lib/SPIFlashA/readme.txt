SPIFlashA (SPIFlash for Anarduino)
=========
Anarduino miniWireless library for read/write access to SPI flash memory chips by emulating the Lowpowerlab SPIFlash (see https://github.com/LowPowerLab/SPIFlash). 
This works with 256byte/page SPI flash memory such as the 128MBIT S25FL127S SPANION used on Anarduino miniWireless (http://www.anarduino.com) for data storage and wireless programming.

This library is developed to enable wireless programming on Anarduino miniWireless platform.
